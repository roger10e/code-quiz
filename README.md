This is stuff about me

## Functionality

Users take a timed quiz on Javascript. They have 60 seconds for 10 questions, and have time deducted for wrong answers.

## Issues

The biggest issue is that the timer does not stop at zero, and does not close out of the quiz when it runs out.
Another issue is that high scores do not get properly saved to local storage.
